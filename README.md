Conjure
=======

Conjure is a minimal, modern, opinionated frontend framework with a focus on developing performant single-page applications. The overall guiding principle of the project is to keep as small of a codebase as possible, with the following hopes: that the framework can be easily understood in a day or less; that it present minimal cognitive overhead to projects which use it; and that the small amount of code allows it to be thoroughly tested.

Technology Advisory
-------------------

Not your father's JavaScript! This is an ES6/ES2015 library and will require `babel` transpilation to ES5 for browser compatibility.

Build Examples
--------------
